	  on sorting

0.85	2011-08-09
	- Heavy code restructuring from static to object oriented code
	+ Added ability to sort the games list and to delete both,
	  entries from list and belonging files on disk
	+ Created a nice icon
	# Fixed bug in hash-creation so all entries are fine now

	  no disc were present


0.60	2007-and-anything
	- Could read ul.cfg and System.CNF from any drive and was able to
	  add new entries
	- No abilities to create game-images or to handle them in any way
	  so image create/copy/rename had to been made by hand
	- had a nasty bug in hash-creation that broke some rare game-entries
