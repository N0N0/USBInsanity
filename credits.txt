Credits go out to some Copyrightholders of tools i used to build this or inspired me to do so.

*** This program was built with those ones: ***

Microsoft(r) for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Professional
	Built almost all my Software with VS - > love .NET

RealWorld Graphics for RealWorld Icon Editor
	Built my fantasticular spectacular icon with it xD

Oleh Yuschuk for OllyDbg
	Used to reverse engineer Usbextreme to get the hash-routine and -table



*** This program is inspired by these ones: ***

USBExtreme/USBAdvance
	no need for description

Ifcaro & jimmikaelkael for Open PS2 Loader aswell as -SP193 for PS2ESDL and 
	if I wouldn't had found these tools i wouldn't had never worked on on usbinsane

ISEKO Team for USBUtil
	Almost perfect and in most ways better than usbinsane it still lacks the support
	for startfiles like BOOT.ELF and PBPX_952.01.

The Makers of UsbInsane and UsbExtreme
	Your tools just built the need for another one ;)


*** This is the biggest keygen i'd ever written ***
